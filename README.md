## Description

An adapter for the ioBroker-system that fetches the latest NFL scores and other NFL related information.

## Current development status, limitations & future goals

### In its current state of development the adapter should be able to...

... do nothing yet. (The adapter just entered the development stage. This section will be updated, once the adapter has basic functionality.)

### In its current state of development the adapter is NOT capable of...

... anything

### Future goals:

- Acquire a list of NFL-teams and create an ioBroker object tree for them.
- Acquire a list of current and upcoming (and maybe recent/past) NFL-Games and create some sort of ioBroker object tree for them.
- Acquire stats for current (currently live) NFL-games (such as scores, game-state, etc.).
- Provide visualizations for the ioBroker-system (ioBroker.vis).

> [!NOTE]
> It is intended to implement all of the above-mentioned 'Future goals' for this adapter.<br>
> However, the feasibility of each of these goals is subject to change.<br>
> None of the functions above are 'guaranteed' to be implemented.<br>
> The above list is not final. Therefore, it might be altered at any time. Future goals might be added or subtracted at any time.<br>
